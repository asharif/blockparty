intro:

little project that can act as a middle man between incoming traffic and the source to drop traffic.  

-The war is just over 700k not minimized.
-After one run though of JIT and debug logs turned off it responds in under 500 microseconds.  Seen it get down under 200 microseconds after a few minutes of burn but my tests were not super rigorous.

build:

- make (this builds a production version) 
- make debug (this builds a debug version that will have debug logging)

files:

-etc/config-{env}.properties - config settings for the app.  see the file.  
*This is passed to the jvm via -Dorg.orphanware.blockparty.config.path=

-etc/ip-black-list - ip and masked ip black list
*This is passed to the jvm via -Dorg.orphanware.blockparty.ipblacklist.path=

-etc/logback-{env}.xml - the logback config file that will be embedded into war

logs:

by default logs go to logs/ directory. 
-what to alarm on?  
-any "ERROR" level logging.  there should be only "INFO" level logging or "DEBUG" level logging if a debug build
